**Spidex3d/Spidex3d** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its mine

Hi I'm The Dyslexic Programmer.
I'm not really a programmer, I'm a retired horticulturist.
iv only played with C++ and found it very interesting
so now I have lots of time to try and learn this stuff.
my aim is to go from all but zero to making a games engine using Opengl.
follow along and watch me make a complete fool of myself.

✨ First weeks Progerss
